## Module 3: Working

### 3.1 User-Defined Headers

### 3.2 Nested Switch

We used Nested Switch structure to connect our code with different personalities of the characters...

Used loops to design our game borders...

We defined the personalities of each character in functions and made it a header file so we can use it anywhere in our main function...

## Limitations

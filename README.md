<h2 align="center">Working </h2>
<p>
<h3><li>User-Defined Headers</li></h3>

We used User-defined header files for containing declaration of functions, variables and other elements that can be reused across multiple source code files...</p>
<h3><li>Nested Switch</li></h3>

We used Nested Switch structure to connect our code with different personalities of the characters...
</p>
<h3><li>Loop</li></h3>

Used loops to design our game borders....</p>
<h3><li>Functions</li></h3>

We defined the personalities of each character in functions and made it a header file so we can use it anywhere in our main function....</p>
